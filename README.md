# Realtime-TTS-Assisstant
It's response time is based on how fast an LLM can reply and I used a low quality TTS program to run it. It's fast but it depends on the quality of the model.   If you run on CPU, then the speed of it replying depends on the models ran on CPU.   I'm going to experiment on other Open sourced TTS and voice cloning like tortoiseTTS and BarkAI.
